# Language modeling using Transformer

If you want to read this notebook, please open it in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) (you can use hyperlinks on functions and classes there)  
You can also open it in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) if you have a intermittent GitHub jupyter notebooks error "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"

### Transformer is used for language modeling. It train on the Hermann Hesse novels (in Russian). Tokenization is provided via [YouTokenToMe library](https://pypi.org/project/youtokentome/). Initial embeddings are derived from a [pretrained BPE model](https://pytorchnlp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/torchnlp.word_to_vector.html#torchnlp.word_to_vector.BPEmb).
